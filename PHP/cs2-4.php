So he goes Super Haven 2 and heads right for the death ball. "Mighty-One don't do it. You're not going to make it," yelled T-Mac. Knowing that Mighty-One isn't most likely using common sense right now, T-Mac tackles Mighty-One so they evade the death ball. T-Mac then leaves Mighty-One and rushes towards the death ball because if it hits the earth it may destroy it because of its power. T-Mac powers up so he can generate a more powerful kamehameha wave.

"We let them get away," says Mighty-One. "I know, but don't worry Snookie can handle herself for the most part. And remember she knows how to get our attention. So lets just head back because there's nothing we can do right now," replies T-Mac. "This blows," says Mighty-One as he angrily hits the ground creating a minor earthquake around the world. T-Boom floats down and says, "How are we gonna break these down to mom. You know she's gonna flip." T-Mac looks at her and shrugs. What will happen to Snookie?
