Getting restless with fighting these two weaklings, Cyborg spots one of the hidden traps in the lab and provokes the boys to come at him as he gets closer to the trap. Back at the Haven house, T-Boom senses T-Mac and Mighty-One's power and goes to wake up Big Dog. "Hey dad, T-Mac and Mighty-One found Snookie. We just gotta follow their power levels and get her back," says T-Boom. "Ok ok, let me put some clothes on and lets go," replies Big Dog. So they head out, going to where the boys power levels were sensed. Inside the lab, Cyborg lures T-Mac and Mighty-One to follow him. Then as they stepped onto the spot that Cyborg needed them to step on, Cyborg presses a button activating a chamber to incapsulate the boys. The chamber was liquified and it disabled any movement whatsoever. "Let them go," yells Snookie. "Now why would I let my two new test subjects go," says Cyborg. Cyborg starts walking towards Snookie. Snookie realizes that the only way to save herself and her brothers is to free her brothers. She immediately drops to a power up stance and begins to transform. Having already seen how the transformation process works, Cyborg quickly attacks Snookie knocking her unconscious again. He picks her up and carries her over to the lab table and puts new shackles on her. T-Mac and Mighty-One furiously look on with no way of helping Snookie. Cyborg turns to the boys and says, "Don't worry now. It'll be your turn as soon as I'm done with her." Cyborg attempts to run his machine on Snookie for the second time. Then BOOM!!!!!! a big explosion in the lab occurs. Dust covers the whole entire laboratory. "You're done for now," thinks Mighty-One. Cyborg looks around but is unable to see. His retinal scan shows that both Mighty-One and T-Mac have escaped their chambers.
