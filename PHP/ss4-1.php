"This is bad, T-Mac stand up and perform the kamehameha wave with me," says Big Dog. "Ok," replies T-Mac. Big Dog and T-Mac stand together and chant, "Ka-me-haa-me-ha" and a ki ball formed in their hands too. "I want you to launch your blast into mine forming one bigger blast, Ok," says Big Dog. "Got it," says T-Mac. Then Spike launches his blast and so do Big Dog and T-Mac. The two blasts collide right into each other. Now there is a power struggle, where whoever loses will be eliminated. At first it seems to be equal, but then Spike puts every bit of his remaining power into his blast. Which starts to give him the upper hand over Big Dog and T-Mac's blast. T-Mac notices that Big Dog can't put anymore power into the blast, and fears that they may be destroyed. So with everything he had left, he unleashes his tremendous power. Which combined with Big Dog, over powers that of Spike. Now the blast has switched directions and wouldn't stop. Spike saw the direction of the blast, and knew it was time for his demise. So he just stopped and took the blast head on. After the explosion was over, Big Dog and T-Mac knew that they had won, but they were totally drained. Back at the house, Mom was making her rounds to see if everyone is in bed. To her surprise she finds T-Mac missing. "Hey Mighty-One, where is your brother," says Mom. "Umm, ohh yeah, he went to go find dad," replies Mighty-One. Mom says, "How long a...." Then suddenly the door opens with Big Dog being carried by T-Mac. "Hey mom I found dad," says T-Mac.
