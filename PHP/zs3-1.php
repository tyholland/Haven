Good thing I came when I did, otherwise T-Boom could've died," says Mighty-One as he holds T-Boom. "And who are you," says Zero. "Our little brother," replies T-Mac. "Another runt is all I see," responds Zero. "Well this runt is gonna kick your but all the way to pizza hut," says Mighty-One. Mighty-One places T-Boom down on the ground. "Hey Mighty-One, amp it up," says T-Mac. "Got it bro," replies Mighty-One. Mighty-One goes Super Haven. "Ohh look, the family trait," says Zero. "Hey Mighty-One blast me," shouts T-Mac. "Why?" responds Mighty-One. "Just do it," says T-Mac. "Ok," says Mighty-One as he launches his Special Beam Cannon at T-Mac. "No," screams Zero as he rushes to block the blast. "Teleport now Mighty-One," demands T-Mac. "Gotcha, Instant Transmission time," says Mighty-One. Mighty-One teleports right next to T-Mac and blast him again releasing T-Mac. Zero stopped the first blast, but looks behind him only to see the free T-Mac. "It's on now," says T-Mac. T-Mac and Mighty-One get ready to attack. Mighty-One starts it off with a kamehameha wave, which T-Mac trails. Zero braces himself for the blast. He catches the blast, then he deflects it away. But right behind the blast is T-Mac holding a ki blast in his right, which he shoves right into the face of Zero. Zero goes flying into a nearby mountain and T-Mac and Mighty-One follow. They unleash a horrible beat down on Zero. They are pounding him, each taking turns going back and forth. Zero is being treated as if he were a toy that the boys didn't like anymore and decided to break. Then the boys do a Double Wammy (Where a person comes from the left side of an opponent and another person comes from the right side of an opponent. Then they hit that opponent at the same time), which sends Zero spinning to the ground. Creating a crater in the ground from the hard hit.
