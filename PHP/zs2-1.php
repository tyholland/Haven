Zero looks upon T-Mac's fight and gets excited, waiting for his turn to fight. T-Boom flies over to her side and does a quick dash punching two henchmen in the stomach. Dropping the both of them to their knees. She then knocks them to the ground by driving her elbows into the back of their necks. She then finishes them off, blasting them to bits. Two more henchmen fly at her and punch her. At least they thought they punched her, because she vanished. "Hey where she go," said henchmen #2. "I don't know," replied henchmen #3. As  T-Boom placed her hands on each of there backs she says, "I'm right behind you." And unleashes two blasts eliminating them. "Come on, can I at least get a challenge," says T-Boom. Now looking at T-Boom's area, he starts to get angry. Since his henchmen are being easily eliminated by two children. T-Mac creates a destructo disk and sends it around in a circle slicing up 10 of his foes. Leaving only two henchmen left. Those two henchmen started running back to ship, fleeing for their lives. Disgraced by his henchmen's display, Zero destroys them himself. T-Boom finishes the rest of her henchmen off with her move, Double Buster. Zero floats down from his ship saying, "I see that my henchmen were no match for u." T-Mac turns to face him and replies, "That's right, what you got." "Don't worry about what I can do, you should be worrying about if you can keep up, " said Zero. "Whatever, whatever. Are you going to leave earth, otherwise we have to fight you." says T-Boom. "I think I'd rather fight," replies Zero as he rushes in on T-Boom. T-Boom gets ready to block, but reacts too slow and gets punched in the stomach. As soon as Zero punched T-Boom, T-Mac came with a hard kick to the head sending Zero back a mile or 2. "T-Boom you Ok," says T-Mac. "Yeah I'm Ok," replies T-Boom.
