Snookie retaliates but Cyborg just dodges her and then hits her behind the neck knocking her out cold. "Dude your totally going down," says Mighty-One as he stutter steps towards Cyborg. "Well just bring......" says Cyborg as he senses two more people with power levels like Mighty-One and Snookie on the way. "Hmm I guess we're going to have a rain check on this fight. But I still want to know how you two humans have managed to get powers. So I'm going to take this girl and run some tests." says Cyborg. "Not in this life time, your not gonna take my sister," replies Mighty-One. "Well if you want her back come on and follow me. If you can," responds Cyborg. Then Cyborg's retinal scan starts to pick up on an increase of power again, coming from Mighty-One. "You better let my sister go," says Mighty-One as lightning bolts occur around him. T-Mac and T-Boom finally appear at the fight. Mighty-One turns as he notices his older brother and sister have arrived. As Mighty-One turns his head, Cyborg takes that opportunity to grab Snookie and make his get away. Mighty-One turns back around and says, "Nooooo, come back." T-Mac drops into a running stance and blasts off trying to follow Cyborg. Cyborg takes off to the air, with T-Mac trailing behind and Mighty-One coming right behind him. Cyborg tries ducking under some mountains and forests. T-Mac and Mighty-One follow with ease. Mighty-One then amps it up and starts moving faster. In a last attempt to get rid of his trailers, Cyborg generates a death ball in his right hand as he carries Snookie over his left shoulder. As the death ball gets bigger and bigger, Cyborg then turns around in the air and faces the death ball at Mighty-One. He waits for it to reach a good size and BOOM!!!! He releases the death ball. Mighty-One sees the death ball, but there isn't any room for him to get around it.
