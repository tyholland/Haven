Mighty-One flies off, rushing to get to Kanton city. Meanwhile T-Boom is fiercely battling Zero. Blow after blow they fight as T-Mac sits, angrily watching from the contents of the barrier. T-Boom runs right at Zero, kicking him in the stomach. Then she flips backwards off Zero's chest, plowing both her feet into Zero's face. Zero goes to the ground, but still gets up. Zero punches T-Boom hard in the face causing her to spin in mid-air. Zero the uppercuts T-Boom, launching her up in the air. Zero does a quick dash and arrives above T-Boom as she is still moving in the upward direction. Zero locks both of his hands together and slams T-Boom back to the ground. Then he starts blasting her while she's on the ground. "Hey why don't you stop picking on girls, and fight me like a real man," shouts T-Mac. "I'll fight you in due time," replies Zero. T-Mac looks up as he senses another  power level. "I'm almost there, just a mile or 2 away," thinks Mighty-One. T-Mac smirks as he realizes who is on his way. T-Boom slowly gets up from all the rubble and debris. She looks up at Zero, filled with anger, she flies up grabbing Zero and then flying back down to the ground at a tremendous speed. Both Zero and T-Boom fighting to gain good position, so they don't go head first into the ground. BOMB!!! They hit the ground and a fog of dirt covers the area. T-Mac looks to see who hit the ground first. As the fog clears he sees Zero standing over T-Boom, generating a ki blast. "Hey say good-bye to your sister, for this is the end for her," says Zero. "Yo if you do it, I'm gonna get you ten times harder, you understand me," yells T-Mac. "Too late, Hahahahaha......." replies Zero. Then a massive explosion occurs, which creates another fog and T-Mac can't see what happened. But he smiles as the fog disappears and he sees none other than Mighty-One. "Wow man, that was a crazy blast.
