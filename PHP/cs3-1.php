T-Mac and Mighty-One head out and T-Boom goes back to sleep. "So where's this place at?" asks T-Mac as they fly above the woods. "It's this hidden laboratory inside of a mountain, where I first saw Cyborg," answers Mighty-One. The boys fly for a while and Mighty-One spots the mountain and they float down to it. "Yo you go in and I'm gonna sneak in behind you and hide in the shadows. Then I'm gonna grab Snookie when the time is right," says T-Mac. So Mighty-One walks into the lab. Inside the lab, "Ok now this may hurt a little," says Cyborg. "What are you gonna do," replies Snookie. "Well I'm going to take a good chunk of blood from you. Which may kill you and I'm gonna test it and see where that power comes from. Alright here we go," says Cyborg. "I don't think so," says Mighty-One. "Mighty-One," says Snookie. "So you found me," says Cyborg. "Let my sister go and maybe I'll let you live," says Mighty-One. "Don't make me laugh human," says Cyborg. Then Cyborg just stops all together. He scans the area and points his hand to a random spot in the lab and says, "I can see you." Then T-Mac walks out and throws a blast at Cyborg. He then says, "Mighty-One go get Snookie now, he can't stop both of us." Mighty-One rushes for Snookie and then Cyborg rushes to get him. T-Mac cuts right in front of Cyborg buying Mighty-One some time. T-Mac instantly transforms into a Super Haven and attacks Cyborg. Mighty-One blasts all the chains off of Snookie, releasing her. "Ok your free, now go home," says Mighty-One as he transforms and then joins the fight. Being stubborn, Snookie decides to stay and watch the outcome. Cyborg easily defends both T-Mac and Mighty-One's attacks.Cyborg punches Mighty-One and roundhouse kicks him in the face. The he takes T-Mac and throws him into one of the machines in the lab creating a big explosion.
