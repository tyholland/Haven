"I'm gonna go back and help the boys fight." says T-Boom. "No stay here. Let the them handle this one. They're all fired up and I have no doubt that they'll win. Besides if you went you would only get in there way." says Big Dog. Back in the lab, Cyborg and T-Mac are in an all out punching contest waiting for the other one to pull back first. However Cyborg begins to get the upper hand in the battle and decks T-Mac. Then he proceeds to stomp on T-Mac. Mighty-One can hear the agony and pain that T-Mac is in from his yells. All of a sudden the ground begins to shake from underneath Cyborg and T-Mac. Kablaam!!!!! Mighty-One comes from under the ground and upper-cuts Cyborg. Cyborg flips in the air, but while Cyborg is flipping in the air he kicks Mighty-One right in the jaw. Once Cyborg gets back on his feet he punches Mighty-One in the stomach causing him to cough up blood. T-Mac comes around with a right hook, but Cyborg counters it by punching T-Mac in the face before T-Mac's arm fully extends. Mighty-One and T-Mac regroup in a corner. "Man why is he so strong all of a sudden?" asks Mighty-One. "I don't know but I think I've got a way to beat him. Remember how when we move really fast, it looks like there is more than one of us. Lets build up a lot of speed and while he's confused on whether we're real or just a shadow we'll strike." replies T-Mac. Sounds like a plan, lets do it." responds Mighty-One. "Come on now are we gonna fight or just talk amongst ourselves." says Cyborg. T-Mac and Mighty-One get up and begin to run in a circle around Cyborg. Getting faster and faster to the point where Cyborg sees doubles of the boys. "Playing games now I see, not a problem." says Cyborg as he sets his retinal scan to locate the real boys. After doing so Cyborg just blasts them. "Hahahahahaha, this is too funny.
