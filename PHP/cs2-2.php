Which makes him stronger than Mighty-One and Snookie and commences his attack again. This time Cyborg is winning the battle. Snookie keeps getting slammed into the ground and Mighty-One is being beaten to a pulp. Cyborg then blasts them both and they fly into a building. "Man either he just got an upgrade or we just got weaker," says Mighty-One. "Well I guess there's only one thing left to do huh!" says Snookie. "You know it," says Mighty-One. "Haaaaaaaaaaaa," yells both Mighty-One and Snookie as they transform into Super Havens. Cyborg sees shinning light coming from the building he just launched the children into. Then his retinal scan picks up on an increase in theur power levels. Before he can even look back up Mighty-One and Snookie are right in his face. Snookie kicks Cyborg from the top and Mighty-One from below almost snapping Cyborg in half. Cyborg gets up from the ground with a smile. "I don't know how your power increased and why your hair color changed, but I'm going to find out. Back at the high school, T-Mac looks for T-Boom and finds her. Then he signals her to come over to him. "You sense that," says T-Mac. "Yeah it's Mighty-One and Snookie," replies T-Boom. "Lets get out of here and find out what's going on," says T-Mac.

Cyborg notices that even though Mighty-One is obviously getting beat, he seems to get an increase in power as he gets angrier. "Why don't you just stay down," says Cyborg. "Because no matter how strong you think you may be. I'm just gonna keep on coming back because I know I can win," replies Mighty-One. Then Cyborg punches Mighty-One in the stomach and then launches a blast with his hand. Sending Mighty-One up in the air and then back down to the ground, creating a crater in the ground.
