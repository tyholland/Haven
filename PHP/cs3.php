T-Mac, T-Boom, and Mighty-One finally go to bed after being yelled at by their mother for losing Snookie. In a dream, Mighty-One sees Cyborg with Snookie. He's in a dark location, and Snookie is hooked up to a machine that can slice her in half. "Do you think you can get past me in time enough to save your sister," says Cyborg. Mighty-One moves and Cyborg grabs him and puts him in a headlock and faces him towards Snookie. "Now watch as your sister dies right in front of your eyes," says Cyborg. "Nooooooo!!!" yells Mighty-One. Then Mighty-One wakes up from his dream, sweating all over. He's breathing heavily and then realizes where Cyborg may have taken Snookie. Back at the burnt laboratory in the mountain, Cyborg has Snookie hooked up to one of Dr. Fergie's machines. Snookie is now conscious and she's looking around the lab. "Hey, I think you should let me go. Otherwise your gonna make my brothers very angry," says Snookie. "Please child, I'm not afraid of anyone. But I do need to know why you humans possess these powers. Also don't even think about powering up since this machine instantly drains your power upon any increase in power," replies Cyborg. Back at the Haven house, Mighty-One goes into T-Mac's room and wakes him up. "What do you want Mighty-One?" asks T-Mac. "I think I know where Cyborg took Snookie," answers Mighty-One. "Are you positive?" replies T-Mac. "No, but it's the only thing that we have to go on," responds Mighty-One. "Alright sounds good to me. But first we gotta wake up T-Boom," says T-Mac. So the two boys walk into T-Boom's room and wake her up. "Hey Mighty-One's got a hunch on Snookie's whereabouts. So we're gonna check it out. You stay on alert and when you sense us, go get dad and come our way," says T-Mac. "Ok, no problem," replies T-Boom.
