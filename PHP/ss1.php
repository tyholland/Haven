Two years pass by, as the children grow and become stronger. Today Big Dog and Mom are home at work leaving the children home alone for a while. "Alright guys, time to wake up. Get Up!!!" says T-Mac. "Alright Alright already. We're up now, calm yourself," says T-Boom. Mighty-One says, "Can we go train today." Snookie says, "Yeah Yeah." "Ok we will, but first lets clean the house and we can go," says T-Mac. Everyone shouts, "Alright" and gets to work. They quickly clean the house, ninja style. They clean up quickly and set out to the woods to begin training. Throughout the training, unknown to the children, they are being watched by someone. "Hmm, I wonder, could these children be that of Big Dog's. If so they're mine," thinks the unknown stranger. Eager to spar with the children, Big Dog finishes up at work early and is let out earlier than normal. Big Dog gets home and finds the house empty, he looks at the time and sees it's 1:00 p.m. So he assumes that the children are training. He heads out the door when all of a sudden he senses another presence with the children. "Hello children," says the unknown stranger. "Who are you," says T-Mac. "You'll find out in due time. Just answer me one question, is your father Big Dog," says the unknown stranger. "And if it is," says T-Boom. "Then it's time for you all to die," answers the unknown stranger. "Mighty-One protect Snookie, and T-Boom you ready to go," says T-Mac. "Ohh yeah, you know it," replies T-Boom. "Hey man you can fight us if you want, but let me warn you. We aren't regular children," says T-Mac. "Ok then, show me what you got," says the unknown stranger. Big Dog rushes, flying as fast as possible, he can sense the children's power levels rising. Meaning that they are in a fight. T-Mac and T-Boom power up and just as they were getting ready to attack, Big Dog shows up out nowhere. "Dad!!!" shouted all the children.
