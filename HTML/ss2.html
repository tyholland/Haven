We are now back at Spike's lair. "Hahahaha I am finally ready, Big Dog can you hear me, IT'S TIME TO DIE," shouts Spike. Spike heads out to an remote area where Big Dog normally passes by, on his way home from work. He waits in the bushes, depressing his energy so he can't be sensed. "Alright, thanks guys. See you tomorrow, bye," says Big Dog. As he leaves his job and heads home. Big Dog walks home and he takes his normal route. Walking through the woods, minding his own business, when a ki blast comes out of nowhere. Big Dog dodges it with ease and shouts, "Whose there." "It is I, your best friend, Spike." replies Spike. "What do you want," says Big Dog. "Well not to be rude or anything, I'm here to kill you," says Spike. "What makes you think a few months of training can make you stronger than me. When even after many years, from the first time I defeated you, you were still weaker than me," says Big Dog. "That time when you beat me, and my family disowned me, it made me wonder how a human could beat me. Then it hit me, that that you weren't all human. At which people thought I was crazy for thinking, but I knew it was true," says Spike. "Ok whatever, just get to the point," replies Big Dog. "Well here's the point, I found a way to give myself as much power as you," responds Spike. "Ohh show me then," says Big Dog. "As you wish," answers Spike. Both Spike and Big Dog power up and get into a fighting stance. Then Spike rushes in and the battle begins. Under the assumption that Spike was the same as before, Big Dog doesn't go all out. Spike starts punching and  Big Dog blocks. Then Spike punches Big Dog in the face, throwing Big Dog back into some trees. Big Dog moves the logs on top of him as he gets back up. Then he sprints toward Spike with rage. He landed a few punches and kicks as well did Spike.
