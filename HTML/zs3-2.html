Zero barely gets up, staggering from left to right. Feeling extremely feed up about his situation, he decides to end it once and for all. "Did you runts enjoy your play time," says Zero. "Why yes we did," replies T-Mac. "Well play times over, here comes the after burners," says Zero as he powers up to his max. Both T-Mac and Mighty-One are pushed back by Zero's enormous power. "Hey not to be stating the obvious bro, but he's clearly more powerful than us now," says Mighty-One. "Thanks for the update," replies T-Mac. Zero blasts T-Mac and Mighty-One sending them into a mountain. Zero flies and punches T-Mac, drilling him further into the mountain. Mighty-One comes from behind and punches Zero. Zero isn't affected at all, he just flings his arm knocking Mighty-One to the ground. Meanwhile T-Boom is still out cold on the ground. T-Mac comes out punching Zero and is blocked on every punch. Zero just punches T-Mac knocking him out of the sky, through some trees, and landing on the ground. Zero follows and lands on T-Mac unleashing continuous punches. With every punch, T-Mac goes a little bit further into the ground and screams in agony. Mighty-One gets up and attacks Zero, but Zero removes one hand from punching T-Mac and blasts Mighty-One back into some debris. T-Boom finally starts to wake up only to find her younger brother in some debris and her twin brother yelling in pain. Can T-Boom provide any help? Can Zero be stopped now?
