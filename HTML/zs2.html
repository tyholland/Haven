Now in front of the star-ship, the twins stand looking at the henchmen. "Hey guys I'm T-Mac," says T-Mac. "And I'm T-Boom," says T-Boom. "By any chance would you guys be the ones destroying Kanton," says T-Mac. "Why yes we are," replies henchmen #1. "Well we're here to stop you," says T-Boom. All the henchmen laugh. Zero walks out of the star-ship to greet his powerful foes, only to see little children. "Who are these little kids," says Zero. "There the ones here to stop us Lord Zero," says henchmen #1. "Yeah that's right," shouts T-Mac. "What!!! Little runts? Take care of them quickly," says Zero angrily. The henchmen start walking towards the children. T-Mac and T-Boom drop into a lower stance and start to say, "Ka-me-ha-me-ha." Unleashing a blast that separates the henchmen to the left and right sides of the blast. Leaving no one in the middle. "Hey T-Boom, I'll take the left side and you take the right," says T-Mac. "Gotcha, lets do it," responds T-Boom. They separate to their assigned spot and get ready for battle. T-Mac gets into the middle of 15 henchmen and lowers himself into a fighting stance. Then he signals with his hand for someone to come. One of the henchmen bites on the bait, and  heads towards T-Mac. T-Mac spins performing a roundhouse kick which connects and spins the henchmen sending him to the ground. T-Mac steps on that henchmen and shouts, "Come On." Two more henchmen fly at him and attack. T-Mac blocks one henchmen with his right hand and leg, and the other henchmen with his left. T-Mac then releases ki blasts out of both hands obliterating both henchmen. Then he looks down at the henchmen he's standing on and blasts him too. He then slowly raises his eyes and looks at the left over henchmen. The henchmen stutter in a backward motion.
