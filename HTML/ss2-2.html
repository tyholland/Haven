Surprised by Spike's strength, Big Dog steps it up. Bang!!! Pow!!! Boom!!! Is all you could hear as these two fought. They're also moving at incredible speeds. The fight seems to be even for the most part, when both fighters get blown back from the might of their colliding punch. They retreat back into fighting stances and Spike powers up again. And in a blink of an eye, they are at each others throats again. After finally acknowledging Spike's power, Big Dog goes Super Haven. (Only people who have the blood of a Haven running through their veins can go Super Haven. Doing this increases your power in tremendous amounts. When you go Super Haven, your hair and eye color changes. Your hair turns yellow and your eyes turn yellow.) Spike pulls back in astonishment of Big Dog's new appearance. "Hahaha I knew it, you are an alien because I definitely know humans cannot do that," says Spike. "As well as my appearance changing, so does my power level. Are you ready," says Big Dog. "Lets do it," responds Spike. Once again they fight, Big Dog throws a ki blast at Spike. Spike blocks it but is pushed back, and  as soon as his arms come down, Big Dog is right in his face and hits him with a right punch. Sending Spike to the ground. The battle continues and Big Dog is winning. Spike is looking real beat up and Big Dog starts to back off, assuming the fight was over, when Spike stands up. He takes out a potion and drinks it. Then he powers up again and his power rises to an all new level. Spike looks at Big Dog, smiles and attacks. Back at the house, with the children is Mom. T-Mac turns his head due to the fact that he senses two strong power levels. "Hey mom, I can sense dad's power level, as well as someone else's. It feels like they both reached there limits. But there is a slight problem," says T-Mac. "What's that honey," replies Mom.
