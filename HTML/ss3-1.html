T-Mac becomes engulfed with unbelievable rage and everything around him begins to shake. The ground starts to crack and separate. His hair began to change colors and become yellow. His eyes turn yellow and Spike can feel T-Mac's power increase. Spike and Big Dog both are in aww as they see T-Mac become a Super Haven at a young age. T-Mac finishes his transformation and stands upright and then into a fighting stance, signaling Spike to come. Spike getting angry by T-Mac's taunt, leaves Big Dog and walks toward T-Mac. His walk turns into a jog which then becomes a dash and he approaches T-Mac. T-Mac throws the first punch, which Spike was unable to block, sending Spike a few steps back. "Ohh look whose gotten a little stronger," says Spike. "Yeah and I suggest you bring your A game," replies T-Mac as he rushes in and begins his assault. The shock waves created from the blows separate trees from their roots. T-Mac flies up and launches his death beam cannon. Spike just barely dodges the blast, but the side of his shirt wasn't as lucky. "You split the side of my shirt," yelled Spike. "Your lucky that was the only thing I split," replies T-Mac. Spike flies up with anger sending ki blasts as he goes. T-Mac deflects with ki blasts of his own and the two throw a right punch that even blows Big Dog back a little. "You are truly strong for a little kid, but I'm done playing around," says Spike. And with that note Spike punches T-Mac sending him back to the ground. T-Mac gets back up as Spike floats back down. Spike rushes him again with speed, so much that T-Mac can't keep up and is punched in the stomach, then the back, and finally his face. Is T-Mac's might enough? Or is Spike's final power too great?
