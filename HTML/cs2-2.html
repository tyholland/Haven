Snookie keeps getting slammed into the ground and Mighty-One is being beaten to a pulp. Cyborg then blasts them both and they fly into a building. "Man either he just got an upgrade or we just got weaker," says Mighty-One. "Well I guess there's only one thing left to do huh!" says Snookie. "You know it," says Mighty-One. "Haaaaaaaaaaaa," yells both Mighty-One and Snookie as they transform into Super Havens. Cyborg sees shinning light coming from the building he just launched the children into. Then his retinal scan picks up on an increase in theur power levels. Before he can even look back up Mighty-One and Snookie are right in his face.

Then Cyborg punches Mighty-One in the stomach and then launches a blast with his hand. Sending Mighty-One up in the air and then back down to the ground, creating a crater in the ground.
