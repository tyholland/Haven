T-Mac is still running through the woods. Feeling like he's getting closer and closer. "How do you like me now, Big Dog," says Spike. Big Dog gets off the ground with cuts and bruises everywhere, bleeding in various spots. "You hit like my mother," replies Big Dog. "Still talking big in the midst of your demise," says Spike. Spike dashes in with speed and punches Big Dog right in the stomach. Big Dog spits out blood and drops to his knees. "Hahahaha, now you bow before me. This is the happiest day of my life," says Spike. "I'm happy to oblige," responds Big Dog. "Well I'm going to end this and next I'm going after your family. After that I'm just going to take over the world," says Spike. Right as Spike is about to unleash his final blow with a powerful ki blast, he hears someone yelling. He turns his head seeing T-Mac yelling, "Kamehameha." A huge blast of ki starts heading towards Spike. Spike looks at it and just flicks it away as if it was nothing. "Go home now," shouts Big Dog. "No no no, come fight. Hopefully your stronger than your dad," says Spike. T-Mac filled with anger and rage rushes right towards Spike with a fury of punches and kicks. Spike blocks every single attack T-Mac launches. To the point where T-Mac feels as if everything he has done up until now was worthless. Spike gets bored and just punches T-Mac, sending him into the ground. Big Dog gets up and starts attacks. Still unable to land a punch, Spike fights in enjoyment. Big Dog steps back and begins a continues fire of ki blasts. Spike deflects everyone and sends the last one right back at Big Dog. Big Dog is sent flying and he hits the ground hard. Spike moves and stomps on Big Dog's stomach over and over. Big Dog is coughing up blood and yelling in pain. T-Mac awakens from the sound of his father being beaten to death. T-Mac sees Spike, jumping up and down on top of Big Dog, enjoying every second of it.
