"Hey dad, you guys should go and take Snookie to safety," says T-mac as he comes from under some machines holding Cyborg's fists. "Yeah we'll take it from here," says Mighty-One. "Alright boys, you be safe," replies Big Dog. Cyborg turns to Big Dog, T-Boom, and Snookie. His chest opens up revealing a mega-blaster. "I never said you could leave," says Cyborg as he unleashes a blast. Mighty-One appears in front of the blast and grabs it with his hands. "Get out of here now, while I can still hold it back," says Mighty-One. "Ok," reply Big Dog and T-Boom. As they fly off, T-Mac drops Cyborg's fists and goes to assist Mighty-One. "Hang in there bro. On the count of three, I'm gonna blast it into the sky." says T-Mac. "Ok, just count already." replies Mighty-One. "1, 2, 3!!!!!" yells T-Mac as Mighty-One releases his hold on the blast and T-Mac blasts it into space. "Wow aren't you two clever," says Cyborg as he reconnects his fists back to his arms. "Well boys this is going to be the last battle of your lives and afterwards I'm going after the rest of your family." stated Cyborg. "Your right about one thing, this is going to be the last battle. But your not the one whose going to be victorious." replies T-Mac. "Then come on and lets see what you got." says Cyborg. "Haaaaaaa..." yell T-Mac and Mighty-One as they transform into Super Haven 2's. Cyborg calculates his power to his max. T-Mac and Mighty-One rush in for the attack and Cyborg prepares himself. Boom!!! A huge shock-wave disperses as the boys fists connect with Cyborg's fists. Now the intense battle begins. Cyborg fights the boys evenly, matching every blow for blow. Then he sees an opening and power punches Mighty-One through the floor and out the bottom of the mountain. Back at the Haven house, "Is she ok." asks Mom. "Yeah she's fine. She's just knocked out," replies Big Dog.
