The newly awakened T-Boom, who had been knocked out by Zero. She sees her brothers, who are beaten. She then goes Super Haven, since she lost it when she was knocked out. T-Boom starts throwing ki blasts at Zero to get him away from T-Mac. Her attempts went unaccomplished. T-Mac gets Zero off of him long enough to say, "T-Boom take Mighty-One and get out of here. I'm gonna send this guy to his grave." Zero laughs at T-Mac's remark and continues to stomp on him. "I'm not leaving without you and Mighty-One," replies T-Boom. T-Boom runs at Zero to attack, but Zero just punches her. He then looks at her as she falls to the ground. "Let them go, its just you and me for now on," says T-Mac. "I'm sorry, did I give you permission to speak," responds Zero as he steps on T-Mac's head. T-Boom turns to see her brother's head being smashed, and blood coming out of his mouth when he coughs. At that moment, T-Boom snaps and screams at the top of her lungs. The ground around her begins to shake and separate. Her hair goes from straight yellow colored hair, to a white colored hair. Her eye color turns white as well, but her power increased again. Zero is beginning to be pushed back by her power. The extremely beaten T-Mac thinks, "She must've broke the boundaries, and transformed into a Super Haven 2." Mighty-One looks up as he sees his older sister take it to the next level. T-Boom stands up, and her feet smash into the ground. "Hey Mighty-One, come get T-Mac and take him to a safe place," says T-Boom. "You got it, Instant Transmission Time," says Mighty-One as he teleports to the spot where T-Mac lays and takes him to another spot. "Ohh no, your hair changed a little. That's nothing, no change in hair can prove that you have more power than me," says Zero. "You wanna come test me and find out," says T-Boom. "Not a problem," says Zero.
