And you thought you could win." says Cyborg.
"Shut up loser," says Mighty-One. "You know what, I don't like your attitude. So I'm going to destroy you first, say goodbye," replies Cyborg as he unleashes a death blast at Mighty-One. But unexpectedly T-Mac jumps in front of the blast, taking the hit for Mighty-One. "Nooooo!!!!" cries out Mighty-One. T-Mac drops to the ground and says "Don't worry about me bro, just finish him off and protect the rest of the family. I Believe In You." Mighty-One looks at T-Mac and says, "I will win just hang on for a little longer bro." T-Mac's eyes close and Mighty-One turns to Cyborg. "First you harm Snookie, then you kill T-Mac. NOW I'M REALLY MAD!!!" states Mighty-One. Mighty-One stands up and beings to power up. Lighten bolts surround his body. "Ohh now that's new." says Cyborg. Mighty-One's entire body begins to glow as his hair forms spikes and turns to a golden yellow color and so does his eyes. "No more time for talk. Only time to show you how a Super Haven 3 fights." replies Mighty-One and then vanishes. Cyborg tries to pick up his movements on his retinal scanner, but gets nothing. Boom!!! Cyborg gets hit in his stomach. Baam!!! Cyborg is kicked in the back. Kablaam!!! Cyborg gets upper-cutted. All the attacks at which Cyborg saw none of. While on the ground, Cyborg looks up and sees Mighty-One waving at him and then Wham!!! Cyborg gets drilled into the floor, then into the mountain, causing the entire mountain to collapse. After everything fell, Mighty-One places T-Mac's body on the ground nearby. Then he goes back to find Cyborg. Cyborg busts out from the ground with flying debris everywhere. "So that's how you want to play." says Cyborg. Mighty-One just looks at him. "Fine, if I can't kill u, then this whole planet will be destroyed with you and me." yells out Cyborg.
