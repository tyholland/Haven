Walking day and night, Cyborg comes across the nearest town. In a matter of a couple of hours, Cyborg destroys this town and all its inhabitants and moves on to his next town. Cyborg destroyed three towns before he comes across Toughtown. Once in Toughtown, he starts destroying buildings and the town alarm goes off (The alarm is an evacuation signal). In the elementary school, Mighty-One and Snookie's teachers warn all the children to go to the metal safe house located under the school just in case of emergencies. On the way to the safe house, Mighty-One grabs Snookie and go into a janitors closet. "Hey Snookie, I over heard the teachers saying someone is destroying the town," says Mighty-One.

"Same here," replies T-Mac. Back in the center of town, Snookie flies up to scout the town for any trouble. "Hey, I found something," says Snookie. "Where?" asks Mighty-One. "West of here," responds Snookie. So they fly over and Mighty-One is shocked by the person they see. "Hey its him, the guy from a couple of days ago," says
