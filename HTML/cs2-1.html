Mighty-One. "Ok, lets go get him," says Snookie as she unleashes a blast at Cyborg. Cyborg's retinal sensors locate a energy blast coming from behind. So Cyborg turns around and sticks his hands out and when the blast reaches him, he just absorbs it. Both of the children are stunned by what they see. "No way, did you just see that. He just absorbed your blast," said Mighty-One. "Hey you, how did you just do that," yells Snookie. Cyborg looks up and sees the child he thought he had destroyed a few days ago. "First off, I see you survived my attack boy. Second, I'm not human, I'm an android. So I have special powers. And third, I'm also wondering why you have powers yourself," says Cyborg. "Well it doesn't matter where we got our powers, all you need to worry about is how your gonna survive battling against us," replies Mighty-One. Cyborg's retinal scan shows that Mighty-One and Snookie are of no threat to him at their current power level. Cyborg moves and appears in between Mighty-One and Snookie. Cyborg hits Snookie hurling her into the base of a nearby building. Making the entire building collapse on top of her. Cyborg turns to Mighty-One and attacks. Cyborg throws some punches, but Mighty-One avoids each one. Mighty-One moves in for the close hit into the gut of Cyborg. Cyborg stumbles back a little allowing Mighty-One to unleash his Kamehameha blast. But once again Cyborg just absorbs the blast. "Ahhh, more energy," says Cyborg. "What that gives you energy," says Mighty-one. "That's right, so blast away," replies Cyborg. Then Mighty-One loses the look of shock on his face and it turns into a smirk. Cyborg looks at him confused and then he turns around. Only to see Snookie slam him down into ground. A large explosion comes from Cyborg hitting the ground. Cyborg stands up and sets his power level to be higher than them.
