"How did you guys get free," said Cyborg. "Apparently you didn't know that we roll 6 deep. So getting rid of us is practically impossible, since there's always another family member out there somewhere," says T-Boom. The dust clears up and Cyborg sees T-Boom holding Snookie in the air. The frustrated Cyborg reaches in his back and pulls out a flame thrower. He blasts T-Boom, engulfing her and Snookie in flames. After the flames disperse, Cyborg sees Big Dog in front of T-Boom projecting a force field. "Just like she said, we just keep coming out of nowhere," said Big Dog. Cyborg becomes even angrier than before. "You might as well give up, because you can't take us all on," says T-Mac. Cyborg turns around and launches both of his fists at T-Mac, knocking him back. "You see, no matter how many of you there is, I will never lose. I'm just too strong," says Cyborg. Then Mighty-One walks out of the shadows. "It doesn't matter how strong you think you are. Just remember this, when you harm my little sister, you should expect nothing less than death," says Mighty-One. "Such big words coming from such a little kid. Like you scare me," says Cyborg. "Too bad, because after I'm done with you, your gonna wish you were afraid of me," replies Mighty-One. What does Mighty-One have up his sleeve? Or will Cyborg dominate as he normally does?
